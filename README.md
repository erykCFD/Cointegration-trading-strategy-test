The following file contains the trading strategy based on the cointegration test between the pair of securities.
The code allows to select the type of cointegration/movement test performed, in this case KPSS (Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin)
where the null hypothesis = there is at least 1 cointegrated pair. 
Additionally the code allows for beta loading- or market neutrality necessary when incorporating this strategy when initiating long/short positions. 
The code works ok, however selection of the pairs remains the crux of the strategy.
